PsychoPy is an open-source application allowing you run a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

PsychoPy is unique in giving you a choice of interface: use the **Builder interface** to build rich, flexible experiments easily or use the **Coder interface** to write extremely powerful experiments in the widely-used Python programming language. The best of both worlds!
